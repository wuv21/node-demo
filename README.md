1. [Fork this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) into your own GitHub account
1. Clone your forked repo to your lab machine or personal computer

We will implement the server(s) together, and I will explain everything as I go along. 

# Viewing the Completed Version

To view the completed version of this exercise, switch to the `completed` branch by executing the following command from within your project directory. Note that if you have uncommitted changes, git will make you commit or stash them before you can checkout the other branch.

```bash
$ git checkout completed
```

To switch back to the master branch, execute this command:

```bash
$ git checkout master
```
